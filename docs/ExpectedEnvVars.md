Environment Variables We Expect in the Environment

What is this?
=============

MrDO is, at the end of the day, a glorified pile of scripts for automating a
single cloud instance for us to play some games on.  I'm not sure what the
'final-version' will look like, but I expect we'll have dozens of simple scripts
for doing things like invoking services, setting up logging files, getting the
machine into the intended configuration from a clean state, and so on.

Assuming that's where we're headed, we should have some documentation on what
scripts are using what environment variables, so that we can know what variables
we should expect to be set, and what they're intended function is.  That way
everyone doesn't have there own way of setting verbosity levels, printing debug
outputs, and so on. This is that document.

PATHS

PATH

LOGGING

LOGS
----
An ideal directory to keep logs generated by components of MrDO. We'd need the directory to be available to all,
but individual logs probably only need to be writable by the scripts that push to them.  Everyone should be able to
read from them.

Currently only (partially) used by duck.sh.

Domain
--------
Where the server is meant to live on the web.  Currently only used by duck.sh
